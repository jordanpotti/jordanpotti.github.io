The Red Team industry is very niche and frankly, there aren't many _simple_ Red Team frameworks. From a technical standpoint, and from a general capabilities standpoint, there are a few [in depth](http://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jdn1_16.pdf) [guides](http://www.sama.gov.sa/en-US/Laws/BankingRules/Financial%20Entities%20Ethical%20Red%20Teaming%20Framework.pdf) but they all are fairly in depth, wordy and difficult to get the interesting bits from.

For the past several years, I have been documenting, taking notes and generally just considering how _I_ think a good Red Team would operate. This ended up in a notebook with a bunch of jumbled thoughts. 

This started with a traditional little maturity pyramid but eventually grew. As this progressed, it became apparent that Maturity Models are *not* dictators of success. There is so much more at play and those will depend on your organization, your leaders, and basically everything. The current state is a [matrix](/) and a [companion](/meta) post. This is sure to adapt and evolve with the Red Team industry.

Major thanks to a couple folks for providing feedback and a ton of suggestions on this, notably [Noah](https://twitter.com/thesubtlety).
