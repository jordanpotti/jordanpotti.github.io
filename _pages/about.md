For the past several years, I have been documenting, taking notes and generally just considering how _I_ think a good Red Team would operate. This ended up in a notebook with a bunch of jumbled thoughts. 

The Red Team industry is very niche and frankly, there aren't many _simple_ Red Team frameworks. From a technical standpoint, and from a general capabilities standpoint, there are a few [in depth](/nothingyet) [guides](/nothingyet) but nothing simple, and focused on the program managment side of things.

This started with a traditional little maturity pyramid but eventually grew. As this progressed, it became apparent that Maturity Models are *not* dictators of success. There is so much more at play and those will depend on your organization, your leaders, and basically everything.
