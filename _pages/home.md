A model to reference when gauging Red Team maturity, as well as set goals and provide guidance when building Red Teams.

 - Please exercise caution when using this model. 
 - This is not a one size fits all, the matrix should be modified to fit the needs of your organization.
 - Maturity levels do not dictate the success of your Red Team. [There are lots of other things at play.](/meta)

## The Questions

**The Questions** are sets of questions that need to be answered at a given maturity level. The answers are highly dynamic and should be reveiwed frequently. 

#### Base Questions
	What does blue assume about their own abilities?
	Who/What is targeting your organization? 
	What are your organizations crown jewels?
	Where are the strengths and weaknesses of the blue team?

#### Advanced Questions
	Where does the critical data live, and how is it transferred between systems?
	Who has access to the critical data? Who is supposed to have access to it?
