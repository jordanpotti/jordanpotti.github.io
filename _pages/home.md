title: The Red Team Maturity Matrix
permalink: /home/
---

A model to reference when gauging Red Team maturity, as well as set goals and provide guidance when building Red Teams.

Disclaimers:
Please exercise caution when using this model. 
This is not a one size fits all, the matrix should be modified to fit the needs of your organization.
If you hate it, let me know how to make it better. 
Chances are, if you really hate it, its not for your organization.

### The Model

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the `_config.yml` file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here.

Making a change to `_config.yml` (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Create a new file called `/_posts/2019-2-13-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. That's all you need to do to publish your first blog post! This [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy while writing the posts.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the <kbd>Create new file</kbd> button in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Using Categories in Reverie

You can categorize your content based on `categories` in Reverie. For this, you just need to add `categories` in front matter like below:

For adding single category:

```md
categories: JavaScript
```

For adding multiple categories:

```md
categories: [PHP, Laravel]
```

The contegorized content can be shown over this URL: <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/categories/>
